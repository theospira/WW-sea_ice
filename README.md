# WW-sea_ice

## Description

This repository contains notebooks and scripts related to the project investigating the role of ocean–sea ice interactions in the Southern Ocean. The aim is to understand the timing of the potential regime shift in sea ice state, centred around Antarctic Winter Water as a stratification barrier.

This work was based on using the dataset: [18 years of hydrographic profiles in the Southern Ocean - Spira et al. (2023)](10.5281/zenodo.10258137)
And uses Winter Water identified from: [The observed spatiotemporal variability of Antarctic Winter Water - Spira et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JC021017)

## Project Structure
