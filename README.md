# WW-sea_ice

## Description

This repository contains notebooks and scripts related to the project investigating the role of oceanâ€“sea ice interactions in the Southern Ocean. The aim is to understand the timing of the potential regime shift in sea ice state, centred around Antarctic Winter Water as a stratification barrier.

This work was based on using the dataset: [18 years of hydrographic profiles in the Southern Ocean - Spira et al. (2023)](10.5281/zenodo.10258137)
and uses Winter Water identified from: [The observed spatiotemporal variability of Antarctic Winter Water - Spira et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JC021017)
